# react-portfolio
Here is a simple portfolio webpage built using React. This assignment allowed me to use react and truly understand the functionality beyond class and put my knowledge to use. Through out creating this, I really feel as though I am getting familair with React.

# Installation
I will add a link to the deployed page here
